# Traffic Prediction

Traffic prediction is the task of predicting future traffic measurements (e.g. volume, speed, etc.) in a road network (graph), using historical data (timeseries).

## Summary

## Performance

NOTE: The experimental setttings may vary. But the common setting is:

* Observation window = 12 timesteps

* Prediction horizon = 1 timesteps

* Prediction window = 12 timesteps
